Summary
====
A database is stored with two files, `index` file and `data` file.

`index` is a large hash table, the chaining of which is separated with linked
lists. `index` file stores all the key strings and references pointing to
entries in `data` file.

`data` file contains all the value data. In order to check out a value of a
specified key, one must query the `index` file first.

Both `index` file and `data` file are block based.


Structure of `index` file:
====

0. header (super block)
1. head information of all linked lists.
2. `bgroups` for linked lists of index entries.

Structure of `data` file:

0. `bgroups` of data.


What is `bgroup`
====

A `bgroup` (block group) is a group of blocks with one special block storing
the Allocation Table (referring to FAT file system) and the other groups
storing contents. `bgroups` are many `bgroup`s with unified indexing.

An Allocation Table stores whether a block it manages is in use, and if in use,
the index of the next block of the linked list. With unified indexing, a block
in one `bgroup` may link to a group in another `bgroup`.
